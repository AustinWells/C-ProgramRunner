# C-Runner
Hello, I made this small program that takes in a file name of a c file and runs it.

#How To Run C-Runner
Step 1: Download the file, and store were you put all your c files. <br/>
Step 2: Open terminal <br/>
Step 3: type  in sh crunner.sh <br/>
Step 4: enter in file name and BOOM! you will see an output. <br/>

#example
```
 >> sh crunner.sh example.c
 >> 
 >> "_______________________________"
 >> "Welcome to the C program runner"
 >> "        By Arjun Dhiman        "
 >> "_______________________________"
 >> "________ Compiling $var _________"
 >> gcc -Wall -o "$var" "$var".c
```
#Purpose
This script was written so that we can easily compile more than one .c at one time.
